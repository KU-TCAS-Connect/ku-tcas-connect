# KU TCAS Connect

*KU TCAS Connect* is an AI-powered chatbot designed to help prospective students navigate the TCAS (Thai University Central Admission System) for Kasetsart University's Faculty of Engineering. Using advanced Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) techniques, the chatbot delivers context-aware responses. By retrieving relevant information from a vector database, it can answer questions about admission criteria, schedules, and more, providing users with personalized guidance.
